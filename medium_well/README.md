# MediumWell
This Ruby Gem provides a CLI view of my Tech category of my Medium feed. You can view the posts by recency or recommendations.

## Installation
$ gem install medium_well

## Usage

Type the below and follow the prompts.

$ medium-well

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
